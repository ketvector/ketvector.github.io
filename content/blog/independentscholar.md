I took a career break in April 2023 to focus on some personal interests - to learn things I always wanted to learn but could not find the time to. You can say I created a brief self taught master's program for me in this period. Along with this, I travelled, spent time with family and spent time thinking about what I should be doing with my life. I am chronicling some of my journey here. 


- To begin, I did a 10 day Vippasana course in Jaipur. Vippasana is a meditation technique developed more than 2000 years ago by the budhists.

- Then, I ended up spending the first 3 months of this period studying physics, something which I had wanted to do for a while. 
    - I started with Quantum Mechanics. I used Leonard Suskind's book and the Nielsen & Chuang reference for my studies. I wrote an introductory article as a reference for new learners, which you can find here: [a tutorial introduction to quantum mechanics](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1A3AWtlZFWzz1Fal_W5_780zdtouJnDod/view?usp=sharing).
    - I then spent some time studying Classical Mechanics (the Hamiltionian/Lagrangian approach), and Special Relativity - both from Leonard Susskind's books.

- I  wanted to learn haskell so I spent some time doing that. And jumped a bit into Category Theory during this same period. You can find some of [my haskell code here](https://github.com/ketvector/haskell-practice)

- I read about philosophy and psychology and was influenced/intrigued/confounded by the works of Carl Jung, Bernardo Kastrup, Thomas Nagel, Nick Bostrom, Kant, Spinoza and others. A brief peek into this journey could be found in the [books here](https://ketvector.github.io/blog/some-books-i-have-read-with-very-short-reviews/)

- I self taught myself AI and Machine Learning - transformers, diffusion models, bayesian reasoning etc. Here are some of my projects from this period. 
   - grading essays by [finetuning BERT](https://github.com/ketvector/essay_grading). 
   - I also taught myself Reinforcement Learning which I really enjoyed. I trained a [simple agent with policy gradient](https://github.com/ketvector/rl).
   - I trained a [diffusion model](https://github.com/ketvector/diffusion).
   - A simple [RAG app](https://github.com/ketvector/talk2file)  
   - To learn the basics of ML, I implemented some of the algorithms from scratch [here](https://github.com/ketvector/ml-practice), although the quality on that one is not great.

- Travelled a bit around India. I visited the Andaman Islands, Varanasi, Bhabhua (Bihar), Lucknow, Delhi, Agra, Chikmagalur, Satara & Harda during this period. Got into bodybuilding and [running](https://ketvector.github.io/blog/10-thoughts-while-running/).
